I am a Ph.D candidate in theoretical high-energy physics in the [Qubits & Spacetime Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/quast) at the Okinawa Institute of Science
& Technology [(OIST)](https://www.oist.jp/) while also being a [QISS](https://www.qiss.fr/) fellow. 

After receiving my BSc in Physics & Astronomy at [Ghent university](https://www.ugent.be/en) in 2019, I pursued a MSc in Physics & Astronomy also at Ghent university until 2021. 
My Master's thesis was on the topic of [``entanglement islands and the black hole information paradox''](https://lib.ugent.be/en/catalog/rug01:003008213?i=1&q=Julian+De+Vuyst)  under the supervision of [Thomas Mertens](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/explorer/eu-trackrecord/heu/heu-erc/bhhqg.htm). During that time, I also spent six months at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en?cb). Thereafter, I taught tutorials to graduate students on QFT as part of the [HEP group](https://hepth.ugent.be/), and in January 2022 finally began my Ph.D at OIST under supervision of [Philipp HÃ¶hn](https://groups.oist.jp/quast/philipp-hoehn).

My interests lie broadly at the interface of quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and cosmology. While having a background in particles and fields, I am currently adding gravity into the mix working on research related to explicitly modelling the observer as part of the system: so-called quantum reference frames [(QRFs)](https://groups.oist.jp/quast/quantum-reference-systems-and-quantum-general-covariance). 
We are trying to enlarge the applicable domain of this approach to field theories.
